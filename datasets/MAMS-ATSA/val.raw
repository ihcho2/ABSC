We went out on the town with the idea that we were going to mingle with the in crowd, you know, go to a place where you pay an outrageous cover charge, have to wear all black to fit in, and pay $12 for a $T$, and if you're lucky, have a good time.

The dinner menu looks like it has a more interesting selection of $T$, but if they are even the fraction of the quality of the items we ate for lunch, I whole-heartedly advise you to make it a point and dine at Creama--if not for the drinks, then definitely for the unique approach to mexican.

We made a $T$ for 5:30pm (20 people) and people were still arriving at 5:45 (over half the group was there) when the manager came over and literally yelled at us for not being on time saying it was a busy time for him, when in fact there were several empty tables throughout the restaurant.

The $T$ is on the good side but not so terrific to compensate the bad service, crammed tiny-tables, dirty glasses, overly loud music, which is good for the bar part of the establishment but not when you want to seat down, eat and have a normal conversation at normal volume.
