I was surprised by the small $T$ from the restaurant to the birthday girl free of charge, but if they're going to give a nice service the one ice cream scoop on a stick didn't leave a strong enough impression.

The food was pretty good, but due to our large size (~16) the $T$ asked us to limit our appetizers to just 3 selections b/c he didn't want to overburden his cooks.

The $T$ Consulting Chef Douglas Rodriguez's forte is blending the diversity of traditional Latin cuisine with modern culinary chic: A celery sorbet cools the spicy-citrus bite of lobster; shrimp seviche and crunchy green plantains coat thick, juicy halibut resting on sweet plantain hash; and tart tomato escabeche moistens a chewy skirt steak.
