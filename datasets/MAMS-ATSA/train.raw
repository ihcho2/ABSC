The $T$ couldn't be better, and the service was outstanding -- at the time there were only two people working the entire bar, and we still got taken care of like it was a five star restaurant.

We hung out by the $T$ mostly to ourselves, not an overwelming social crowd, but there were some georgous groups of hipsters looking like it was their meeting up before going out to the clubs (a few of the girls looked like top models), but the vibe was real chill.

($T$ was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.

The $T$ were too close together, the food wasn't impressive, and the service was often times completely missing - waiting 45 minutes between ending dinner and being asked about dessert is not what a restaurant of this caliber should be all about.

$T$, shrimp, mussels, scungilli, and calamari served together in a spicy red sauce atop linguine are full of flavor; steak pizzaiola, a heroic portion of tender beef in a pool of garlicky marinara, comes with a side of spaghetti.

Most $T$ are smothered in melted cheese or merely mediocre; flan is flat and pedestrian, drenched in tasteless sugar syrup; and even its supposedly best feature - the margarita - is a hit-or-miss affair.

The last three times I've called (in addition to asking me to wait for a long time before taking my order), they've given me grief about asking for delivery even though my address is clearly within the map printed on the $T$, just because the delivery guy gets mad if he has to go out of his way.

The food is average, at best (I have been repeatedly underwhelmed by the mediocre $T$) and the service is only good if Elaine is within range.

overall the $T$ we ordered (pancit luglug, chicken adobo, romy's ribs, lumpia shanghai, a bowl of green soup that resembles the polyjuice potion harry potter drank) was not screaming with taste.

She walked away in a huff, and had the $T$ pass on the same message: you can't order coffee because you've already paid (have these people never heard of someone changing their mind?

The only downfall was that our $T$ never showed up, we were apologized to, and it wasn't on our bill, but we also didn't get the jumbo shrimp we were all craving.

My first and LAST visit included a $T$ telling me We're casual- pour your own wine and then handing me a check with a place for the Captain's tip.

In my experience, Olympic Flame, a traditional NYC Greek coffee shop, offers good value for one's money in terms of $T$ but passable to rude service, depending on who you get.

I was intimidated by the $T$ - which is entirely in Italian, and the wine list - which strictly lists Italian wines, but my waiter - Nathan - was quick to help.

$T$ BQ will knock your socks off with every entree (pulled pork and the ribs -- go full rack, kid, it won't do you wrong) and the homey taste of the sides (love that slaw, them beans, and all that tater salad) matches up perfectly.

The $T$ doesn't disappoint: A well-heeled, fashionable clientele packs the polished-wood-and-glass-partitioned space, settling into one of two dining rooms, or the bar, which is located at the farthest corner from the entrance.

Good $T$ - it was hard to make a decision between the breakfast tacos, huevos rancheros, and salads on the menu although our waiter was happy to rank menu items upon our request.

The $T$ were incredibly attentive, though as a warning, if you like wine, but also a little privacy, this might not be a good idea, since they have the tendency to hover a bit.

The $T$ has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often.

YYMV, we visited for Restaurant Week so the $T$ of the food may have been below normal standards because of the crowds.

The best thing on the $T$ was probably the creamed spinach side and that's saying alot for a steakhouse.

The $T$ was quite bland, and the saag paneer was a huge disappointment--more like some kid's worst experience of creamed spinach with tofu-like cheese.

The downside is that perhaps due to $T$'s eclectic nature, the chef has trouble cooking any single type to perfection.

My friends and I dropped by on a Sunday, and there was absolutely NO $T$ (the supposed only female bartender even told us there was no one else but her, and given that there were people in there waiting to dine and drink, that was ridicoulas!

We loved the recommendation for the $T$, and I think the eggplant parmigiana appetizer should become an entree.

The $T$ sounded good but the grilled eggplant roll was oversauced with a pile of mint, pork chop was leathery, and everything just tasted wrong.

$T$ is coddling and correct and there's no sense of hurry, so diners linger over a cheese course or a round of liqueurs.
